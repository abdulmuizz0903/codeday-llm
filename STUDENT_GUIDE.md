# 🤖 CodeDay LLM Workshop - Student Guide

Welcome to the exciting world of Large Language Models! This guide will help you understand how to interact with AI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Method 1: Use the Web Interface 
1. **Try it yourself first**: Open a terminal and run `python main.py`
2. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:2718
3. Start chatting with the AI!
4. **If it doesn't work**: Ask your mentor for help

### Method 2: Use the Terminal (Command Line)
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run: `python demo.py`
4. Start typing your questions directly in the terminal!
5. **If it doesn't work**: Ask your mentor for help

**💡 You can try both methods!** Feel free to experiment with both the web interface and the terminal version to see which one you prefer. **Start by trying to run them yourself - it's part of the learning experience!**

## 💡 Tips for Better AI Conversations

### ✅ Good Prompts:
- "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms"
- "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint"
- "Help me understand why the sky is blue"
- "What are 3 fun facts about penguins?"

### ❌ Avoid These:
- Very long messages (keep under 500 characters)
- Asking for personal information
- Requesting harmful content

## 🎯 Cool Things to Try

1. **Creative Writing**: Ask the AI to write stories, poems, or jokes
2. **Learning Helper**: Get explanations for school subjects
3. **Code Buddy**: Ask simple programming questions
4. **Fun Facts**: Learn interesting facts about any topic

## 🔧 Understanding the Controls

- **🌙/☀️ Button**: Switch between light and dark mode
- **🗑️ Clear Chat**: Start a fresh conversation
- **Response Time**: See how fast the AI responds

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **You type** a message
2. **The AI reads** your message and all previous messages
3. **It thinks** about the best response
4. **It sends back** its answer
5. **The conversation continues** with context!

## 🎓 What You're Learning

- How to communicate with AI systems
- The importance of clear, specific questions
- How AI maintains conversation context
- The basics of human-AI interaction
- **Problem-solving skills**: Learning to troubleshoot and ask for help when needed
- **Technology exploration**: Trying different ways to interact with the same AI system

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Try to solve problems yourself first - it's great practice!** But don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it:

- **🔧 Technical Issues**: If either `python main.py` or `python demo.py` doesn't work after trying the troubleshooting steps, call your mentor
- **📱 App Problems**: If the web interface isn't loading or responding, ask your instructor for help
- **🤖 AI Confusion**: Try rephrasing your question if the AI doesn't understand
- **💡 General Questions**: Your mentors are here to help - don't hesitate to ask!

## 🔧 Quick Troubleshooting

**Try these steps first before asking for help:**

### If you get an error when running the files:
1. **Check Python**: Make sure Python is installed (`python --version`)
2. **Check Location**: Ensure you're in the correct project folder
3. **Try Both Files**: If `main.py` doesn't work, try `demo.py` (or vice versa)
4. **Read the Error**: Look at the error message - it often tells you what's wrong
5. **Call for Help**: If you've tried the above and still have issues, show the error to your mentor

### Common Issues:
- **"Command not found"**: You might need to use `python3` instead of `python`
- **"Module not found"**: The required packages might not be installed
- **"Port already in use"**: Someone else might be running the server

**👨‍🏫 When in doubt, ask your mentor!** They're here to help you succeed, but trying to solve problems yourself first is a valuable skill.

**Remember**: It's normal to encounter problems when learning new technology. Part of becoming a good programmer is learning to troubleshoot issues independently. Your mentors are experienced and ready to help you when you get stuck!
