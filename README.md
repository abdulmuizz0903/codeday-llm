# Codeday Kashmir 2025
## LLM Workshop
### Prerequisites
You need the following installed on your system:
- A Python environment (3.9+ recommended)
- A NodeJS runtime (20.0+ preferred)
- An IDE
- A Browser
### Setup steps
- Install the requirements of this project by running: 
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Create a GroqCloud account and obtain an API key. IF RUNNING LOCALLY, store it in a file named `.env` in this folder as `GROQ_KEY=[your_key]`. IF RUNNING ON CODESANDBOX: Click the top left square -> Settings -> Env variables. Set the *Name* of the variable to `GROQ_KEY` and copy-paste the key into the *Value*.
- Run the file named `main.py` by running:
```python main.py``` (**NOTE:** Some runtimes may have a different command instead of `python`, one which includes a version number. e.g. `python3.12`. In that case, run `python3.12 main.py`)
- Using a virtual environment for this project is recommended, but optional.
